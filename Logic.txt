3 "wheels"

Wheel 1:
	Randomly selects a monster
Wheel 2:
	Randomly Selects a weapon

Wheel 3:
Selects a damage type:
	randomly selects between Raw, Element, and Status
		- if Raw is selected, display Raw 
			- if light bowgun or heavy bowgun was selected on the previous wheel, then instead of RAW, select an ammo type
			- if gunlance was previously selected, choose a shelling type
		- if Element is selected, then randomly select an element
		- if Status is selected, randomly pick a status

UI idea:

randomly select a background from the folder then draw stuff on top?

have a triangle with button at bottom:
			
			Monster



Damage Type					Weapon

			Spin Button


By default each image would show the unknown image until user clicks the button

when button is clicked randomly cycle through images from respective folders for 5 seconds or until results are chosen (longest time) then display final results 

Maybe display the image file name below the image?

final results could use the file names to create a text splash that says "Hunt [monster] with [damage type] [weapon]!"

something fun to alert the user that the results are in?
